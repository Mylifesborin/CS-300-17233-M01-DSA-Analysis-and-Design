# Reflection

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**  
I worked on analyzing data structures for managing course data and created a program to sort and display courses in order.

**How did you approach the problem?**  
I compared vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees to find the best option. I picked the binary search tree because it keeps data sorted and works well for searches.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks?**  
I handled issues like bad file data and input errors by testing my code step by step and improving file handling and input checks.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software?**  
This project taught me to pick the right tools for the job and focus on both performance and keeping my code easy to understand.

**How has your work on this project changed how you write programs?**  
I now write cleaner, more organized code and plan for future updates by keeping everything simple and flexible.
